# Valuing American Options by Simulation

## Final Project - FRE 6831

In this project, we would implement an algorithm to price American Options by simulation.

The model is flexible and applicable in path-dependent and multifactor situations(i.e. exercise payoff is calculted as in Asian options) where traditional finite difference techniques cannot be used..
